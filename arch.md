# Keys trolling with signing

The error you are encountering suggests that the PGP signature for the archlinux-keyring package cannot be verified. This issue can often be resolved by refreshing the keyring and ensuring that your system trusts the required keys. Here's a step-by-step guide to resolving this issue:

1. Manually Refresh the Keyring
Try manually refreshing the keyring with the following commands:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/gnupg
sudo pacman-key --init
sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux
sudo pacman-key --refresh-keys
```

2. Reinstall the archlinux-keyring Package
After refreshing the keyring, reinstall the archlinux-keyring package:

```bash
sudo pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring
```

3. Update the System
Once the keyring has been updated, you can proceed with updating your system:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```

4. Manually Import the Key (if the issue persists)
If the issue persists, you can manually import the specific PGP key:

Obtain the key ID: The key ID in your case is Christian Hesse <eworm@archlinux.org>.

- Import the key:

```bash
sudo pacman-key --recv-keys <key_id>
```

- Sign the key as trusted:

```bash
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key <key_id>
```

Replace <key_id> with the actual key ID. In this case, you might want to try:

```bash
sudo pacman-key --recv-keys F99FFE0FEAE999BD
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key F99FFE0FEAE999BD
```

## Clean the Package Cache
Sometimes, cached packages can cause issues. Clear the package cache:

```bash
sudo pacman -Sc
```

Then, try updating the keyring again:

```bash
sudo pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring
```

# Summary of Commands

```bash
sudo rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/gnupg
sudo pacman-key --init
sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux
sudo pacman-key --refresh-keys

sudo pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring
sudo pacman -Syu

sudo pacman-key --recv-keys F99FFE0FEAE999BD
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key F99FFE0FEAE999BD

sudo pacman -Sc
sudo pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring

# Pacman error

1. Change the Download Mirror
Sometimes the mirror you are downloading from may be slow or experiencing issues. You can change the mirror by editing your mirror list.

Edit the Mirror List:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

Move a Different Mirror to the Top:
Place a faster or more reliable mirror at the top of the list. For example, you can try a mirror from your region.

2. Update the Package Database and Try Again
Once you have updated the mirror list, try updating the package database and upgrading again:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syyu
```

3. Increase Timeout
You can also increase the timeout period in the pacman configuration:

Edit pacman.conf:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/pacman.conf
```

4. Use Alternative Download Methods
You can manually download the package from a web browser and then install it locally:

Download the Package Manually:
Visit Arch Linux Package Search and download the package manually.

Install the Downloaded Package:

```bash
sudo pacman -U /path/to/downloaded/package.pkg.tar.zst
```

5. Check Internet Connection
Ensure your internet connection is stable and try disabling any proxies or VPNs that might be interfering with the download.

By trying these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and complete your package upgrade successfully.

```bash
checking for file conflicts...
error: failed to commit transaction (conflicting files)
gcc13: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib/libgcc_s.so exists in filesystem (owned by gcc12)
gcc13: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 exists in filesystem (owned by gcc12)
ChatGPT
The error message you are seeing indicates that there are file conflicts between the gcc13 package and the currently installed gcc12 package. Specifically, the files /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib/libgcc_s.so and /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 already exist in the filesystem and are owned by the gcc12 package.
```

Here are steps to resolve the issue:

1. Check for File Conflicts
First, you should check what files are causing the conflict:

```bash
pacman -Qqo /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib/libgcc_s.so /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib/libgcc_s.so.1
```
This command will tell you which package owns these files.

2. Force Install
If you are sure that the files from gcc13 can safely overwrite the existing ones from gcc12, you can force the installation:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --overwrite /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib/libgcc_s.so /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 gcc13
```
3. Remove Conflicting Package
You can also choose to remove gcc12 before installing gcc13:

```bash
sudo pacman -R gcc12
sudo pacman -S gcc13
```

4. Backup and Remove Conflicting Files
If you want to be cautious, you can backup the conflicting files before removing them:

```bash
sudo mv /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib/libgcc_s.so /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib/libgcc_s.so.backup
sudo mv /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib/libgcc_s.so.
sudo pacman -S gcc13
```


5. Use `pacman -Qkk` to Verify Package Integrity
After resolving the conflict and installing the new package, you can use pacman -Qkk to verify the integrity of installed packages:

```bash
sudo pacman -Qkk
```
